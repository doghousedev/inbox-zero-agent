To supplement this thread of conversation, I want to acknowledge and express gratitude for John’s creative efforts with posters and especially videos, all of which aids our promo efforts. He and I have also been capturing audio for promo purposes. Most excellent teamwork!

I need to review our online audio to refresh and renew those milestones.

Also many thanks to Diane Haller and Cynthia Garland for their photo and video captures.

It also takes a village to nurture a band, and I am grateful for all efforts.

Ok, must ready our home for our young grandson’s visit. Look out, cats!

See you tomorrow at noon!
